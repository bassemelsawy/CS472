        <dt>Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
            <pre>
            x = 1;
            var a = 5;
            var b = 10;
            var c = function(a, b, c) {
                var x = 10;
                document.write(x);
                document.write(a);
                var f = function(a, b, c) {
                        b = a;
                        document.write(b);
                        b = c;
                        var x = 5;
                    }
                f(a,b,c);
                document.write(b);
            }
            c(8,9,10);
            document.write(b);
            document.write(x);
        </pre>

            10 8 8 9 10 1
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the difference between a method and function?
        </dt>
        <dd>A method is a function that belongs to an object. A function is a piece of code that
            is not associated with an object.
        </dd>
        <dt>What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            In Java, this refers to the current instance object on which the method is executed.
        </dd>
        <dt>What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?
        </dt>
        <dd>In JavaScript this always refers to the “owner” of the function we're executing, or rather, to the object
            that a function is a method of.

        </dd>
        <dt> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            this in a JavaScript constructor refers to the object that was just created.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword
            'this'.
            When f is called by x.f(), what does 'this' refer to?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            It refers to the object x
        </dd>
        <dt>What is a free variable in JavaScript?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Free variable is a variable referred to by a function that is
            not one of its parameters or local variables.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
            that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <pre>
               var obj = {
                   name: "fred",
                   major: "music",
                   myFunc: function(x,y){
                        return x>y?y:(x&lt;y?x:x*y)
                   }
               }
           </pre>
        </dd>
        <dt>Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor
            function.
            Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.

        </dt>
        <dd>
            <pre>
                function Employee(name, salary, position) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.salary = salary;
                    this.position = position;
                }

                var john = new Employee("John", 10000, "Manager");
                var eric = new Employee("eric", 10500, "Staff");
                var rock = new Employee("Rock", 50000, "WWE Champion");
            </pre>

        <dt>Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
            arguments.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <code>
                function product(a,b, ...more) {
                    var total = a * b;
                    if(more.length > 0) {
                        for(var i=0; i&lt;more.length; i++){
                            total *=more[i];
                        }
                    }

                }
            </code>

        <dt>Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.</dt>
        <dd>
            <code>
            <pre>
            var max = (num1, num2, num3) => Math.max(num1, num2, num3)
