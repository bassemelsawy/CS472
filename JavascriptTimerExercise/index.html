        <dt> What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
            <pre>
                setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
                setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
            </pre>
        </dt>
        <dd>setTimeout(booyah, 2000) calls booyah after a delay of 2 seconds
            whereas setTimeout(booyah(), 2000) calls the function booyah immediately.
        </dd>
        <dt>What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
            <pre>
                var myfunc = function(a, x) {
                 return a * x;
                };
                var x = myfunc(2, 3);
                var y = myfunc;
                alert(x);
                alert(y(2,3)); 
            </pre>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The function shows two alert boxes with value 6 in each one.
        </dd>
        <dt> Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
                says “BOOYAH!”
                </dt><dd>
            <pre>
                function booyah1(){
                    var msg = "BOOYAH";
                    alert(msg);
                }
                    
                function booyah2(){
                    setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);        
                }
            </pre>

        <dt>What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
                for using it)?</dt>
        <dd>Unobtrusive Javascript is a way of using JS code in the front end such that
            the HTML structure and behavior are separated. Unobtrusive Javascript is used to:
            <br>
            1. Separation of functionality/behavior from a Web page's structure/content and presentation <br>
            2. To avoid the problems of traditional JavaScript programming and create more modular codes
